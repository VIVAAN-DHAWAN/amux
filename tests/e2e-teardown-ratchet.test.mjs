/**
 * AMUX-4737. A `finally` that throws DISCARDS the exception coming out of
 * `try`, so a teardown failure silently REPLACES the error the test was
 * actually reporting.
 *
 * Measured cost: AMUX-4642 and AMUX-4643 sat for two days titled with their
 * teardown's secondary failure ("Back click times out", "request context
 * closed") while the steps that broke were linked-record.spec.ts:78 and
 * files-upload.spec.ts:35. Both were the same dialog bug; three wrong diagnoses
 * were produced before a teardown was made non-throwing, and the real error
 * appeared immediately.
 *
 * THIS IS A RATCHET, NOT A GATE, and the distinction is the honest part. 47
 * unguarded blocks remain. Converting them all at once is a large mechanical
 * change across the whole e2e suite with real regression risk and no way to
 * verify each one except by breaking it. So the number is recorded and may only
 * go DOWN. Lower it when you convert one; it is not allowed to rise.
 *
 * WHAT THE NUMBER COUNTS, precisely, because it is not "unsafe teardowns". It
 * counts `finally` blocks that await something other than `cleanup()`. A block
 * awaiting a helper that is itself non-throwing reads as unguarded here: the
 * scanner cannot see inside a callee. `deleteOwnedWorkers` is exactly that case
 * and was fixed at the helper (it closes the overlay by calling its handler
 * rather than clicking it), so its callers are safe and still counted.
 *
 * That over-count is deliberate rather than a defect to fix with an allowlist:
 * an allowlist of known-safe helpers is a second list to keep true, and the
 * ratchet only needs to stop the number RISING. The baseline was set from a
 * measured run, not an estimate; the first guess was 46 and the scanner found
 * 47.
 *
 * The complementary fix already exists for fixture-managed cleanup:
 * e2e/worker-lifecycle-fixture.ts plus tests/worker-lifecycle-cleanup.test.mjs
 * prove the same property through a real Playwright run
 * ("mid-flow failure remains the only error after guarded fixture removal").
 * `e2e/teardown.ts`'s `cleanup()` is the per-spec form for the blocks no
 * fixture owns.
